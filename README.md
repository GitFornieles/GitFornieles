   <br> (Full Stack Developer / Industrial Engineer)</h2>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p align="justified">
   During my ten years as an engineer, I've been in charge of several kinds of projects and teams, information, budgets and projects; solving complex problems and meeting deadlines. A year ago, after analyzing my situation and considering all my options, I decided to make a break in my career, challenging myself through entering this new fast growing and quickly evolving world of IT.</p>
   <p>I've always had a knack for data/info management, finding logic (the true "how?") behind procesess and procedures. Moreover, my background as an engineer has gave me a like for designing logical step by step solutions, so when I had the chance to assist a client in it's own management system design, I realized this was what I wanted to dive into.</p>
  <p> Now, after finishing a Full Stack Developer Coding Bootcamp, I am beginning my path as a Full Stack Web Developer.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  There is always something to learn! After recently finishing Plataforma 5's Coding Bootcamp, I'll be moving forward to:
  - MongoDB
  - NextJS
  - React Native
  - BlockChain
<br />

### ðŸŒ± Last Milestone:
  <p>On December 2022, after months of high intensity training, I finished an 800+ hours coding bootcamp.</p>
  <p>It was an intensive course, going through the PERN stack for Web development:</p>
  <p>First stage consisted of almost 2 months with continuous practice of each of the following technologies, a new subject every day </p>
     
  - JAVASCRIPT ES6:
    Data Structures, Selectors, Sorting, Classes, Objects, Promises.
  - HTML and CSS
    Tags, Structure, libraries, Flex, Sass, Media Query, Sass
  - SQL
    Database, Queries, T-SQL, Schema Design, PostgresSQL, ORM Sequelize
  - NODEJS
    Bash, Built-In globals/Modules, NPM, Web Servers, Express, Auth, Axios
  - REACT
    JSX, React App, Hooks, React Router, React Context, Redux.

   <p>This stage ended with an individual integrative project.</p>
   
   <p>The second stage consisted of the development of projects in teams, using SCRUM methodology.
    Projects were organized in Sprints, MoSCoW method was used to establish priorities, and "Daily" meetings were scheduled at the beginning of each day to organize every activity.
   Two complete projects were delivered:
    E-Commerce, presented before a Platforma5's jury.
    GetViral, presented before the Client.
</p>

<h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
   <p>I first started coding in "Logo Writer". Yes, "the little turtle". A very simple program designed for helping children make their first steps in programming. And it was fun.</p>
   <p>Some years later, I played a little with Basic and then Visual Basic; although always more as "something to do".</p>
   <p>Finally, in a more "professional environment" I started working with Excel's macros at my first job. And even though it may not be considered strictly "programming", I saved hundreds of hours just by thinking the complete flow of information, detecting where and how to process it; and what output was required.</p>
   <p>Throughout my entire career as engineer, I always ended up being the one responsible for designing the flow and management of information; and in some cases, even being the representative of (and responsible for) my department in IT projects.</p>
   <p>Decided to make the change, last year I planned two stages:
      During the first half of 2022, I attended several courses:</p>
      
  - Python Programming
  - Python for Data Analysis
  - HTML5, CSS
  - SQL Server 2019
  - JAVA Standard Web Programming
  - Javascript from scratch
  
   <p>And finally, in September, I started the Coding Bootcamp as the final stage in my initiation of this new path.</p>
